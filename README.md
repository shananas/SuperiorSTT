# SuperiorSTT

Actually play as Sora in STT with his Combos and everything.
It is recommended to have Roxas Magic/Movement/Trinity enabled so Sora can use Magic and Trinity but this will work regardless of that setting.

It seems this fixes the infinite drive in STT so Sora will lose drive when reverting from limit form.

Both Roxas and Dual-wield Roxas are replaced by base Sora.
