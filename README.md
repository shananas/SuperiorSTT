# SuperiorSTT

Actually play as Sora in STT with his Combos and everything. It does not matter if you have Roxas Magic/Movement/Trinity on or off this mod will essentially turn it on.

It seems this fixes the infinite drive in STT so Sora will lose drive when reverting from limit form.

Both Roxas and Dual-wield Roxas are replaced by base Sora.
